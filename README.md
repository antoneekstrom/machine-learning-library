# machine-learning-library
A machine learning library.
It contains functionality for variable size matrices and vectors. It also has a somewhat functioning neural network in the form of a feedforward multilayer perceptron (I think it is called that, either way it sounds epic ngl)

## Features

### XOR
Can successfully solve XOR "problem", which allows this magnificent creation to act as a stupidly overcomplicated and inefficient logic gate.

### Handwritten digit recognition (doesn't work)
Trained using the MNIST dataset the network is unable to work properly because it is bad.

Using large hidden layers will result in large numbers and therefore exclusively output ones. If using small layers it will overfit almost immediately and output near-zeroes for everything. It's a work in progress, ok (I need help).
